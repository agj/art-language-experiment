Art Language Experiment
=======================

This is an experiment in creating a **high-level language for artistic creation** and visual design, particularly aimed at non-programmer, artistically oriented individuals. The ultimate focus is squarely on its design and psychology of use, above any technical and otherwise practical considerations. It is a _laboratory language_.

Currently being developed as a domain-specific language in [Racket][racket], it is in its very early stages, with different approaches being prototyped. Right now it is being conceived as a plain text programming language, but it may develop into a visual language (visual interface standard?), or some other format that would help better achieve its goals.

The **first milestone** is to create a language that facilitates static (non-animated, non-interactive) image creation.
